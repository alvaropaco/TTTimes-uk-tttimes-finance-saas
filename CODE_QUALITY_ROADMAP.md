# Code Quality Enhancement Roadmap

## ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Improvements (High Impact, Low Effort)

### 1. Error Handling & Logging
- [ ] Implement centralized error handling with proper error boundaries
- [ ] Add structured logging with different log levels (info, warn, error)
- [ ] Create custom error classes for different error types (ValidationError, AuthError, etc.)

### 2. Type Safety Enhancements
- [ ] Add strict TypeScript configuration (`strict: true`, `noImplicitAny: true`)
- [ ] Create comprehensive type definitions for API responses
- [ ] Implement runtime type validation with Zod or similar library

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement React.memo for expensive components
- [ ] Add proper loading states and skeleton components
- [ ] Optimize bundle size with dynamic imports for heavy components
- [ ] Add image optimization and lazy loading

## ðŸ”§ Medium-Term Improvements (Medium Impact, Medium Effort)

### 4. Testing Strategy
- [ ] Set up Jest and React Testing Library
- [ ] Add unit tests for utility functions and hooks
- [ ] Implement integration tests for API routes
- [ ] Add E2E tests with Playwright or Cypress

### 5. Code Organization
- [ ] Implement feature-based folder structure
- [ ] Create shared constants and enums
- [ ] Add proper barrel exports (index.ts files)
- [ ] Separate business logic from UI components

### 6. API Improvements
- [ ] Implement OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- [ ] Add request/response validation middleware
- [ ] Create standardized API response format
- [ ] Implement proper CORS configuration

## ðŸš€ Long-Term Improvements (High Impact, High Effort)

### 7. Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Integrate application monitoring (Sentry, DataDog)
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and metrics
- [ ] Implement health check endpoints
- [ ] Add request tracing and correlation IDs

### 8. Security Enhancements
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [ ] Add input sanitization and validation
- [ ] Implement proper session management
- [ ] Add security headers middleware

### 9. Developer Experience
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks with Husky
- [ ] Add automated code formatting with Prettier
- [ ] Implement conventional commits
- [ ] Add automated dependency updates

## ðŸ“Š Code Quality Metrics to Track
- Test coverage (target: >80%)
- Bundle size (monitor and optimize)
- Performance metrics (Core Web Vitals)
- Security vulnerabilities (automated scanning)
- Code complexity (ESLint complexity rules)
